# MapReduce in C++
For fun. For learning.

## Build

This is a CMake project. Do the normal CMake thing. Minimum version required as of last writing is 3.16. Please check `CMakeLists.txt` for the final word.

To build, for example:

```shell script
cmake -S <path-to-this-dir> -B <path-to-a-build-dir-of-your-choosing>
cmake --build <path-to-that-same-build-dir>
```

The CMake targets are the MapReduce library itself `libsb-mapreduce`; and a demo `dev-demo` that runs a word count job.

The library can be built as shared (dynamic) or static using the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` switch at configure time, defaulting to static.

```shell script
cmake -S <path-to-this-dir> -BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON     # Build as shared lib
```

The built library can be found in `<path-to-build-dir>/src`.

The built `dev_demo` executable can be found in `<path-to-build-dir>/exe`.

If you do not wish to build the demo, the option `SB_MAPREDUCE_BUILD_DEMO` can be set at configure time.
If you are using this CMake project as a sub-project of your own build, the demo will not be built by default, but you can override this by setting that option.

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, before configuring, you must have a `<path-to-this-dir>/data` directory.
This directory must in turn have subdirectories `inputs` and `outputs`.
The input file to word count must be in the `inputs` directory.

As of last writing, this defaults to "pg-being-earnest.txt".
This file, along with other example text files, can be downloaded from TODO MIT GITHUB.
The output file will be in `outputs/word_count.txt`.

When running the demo, your current working directory must be the CMake build directory you previously specified.

## Using the MapReduce library

### Including the Headers

The `libsb-mapreduce` target exposes a public include directory.
Any required headers (whose use will be demonstrated below) can thus be included as follows in your code:
```c++
#include <sb-mapreduce/some-header.h>
```

### Naming Conventions and Namespaces

As shown, the headers use a `lower-kebab-case` style.
The types they expose will use an `UpperCamelCase` style, with their members (and any free-standing functions, etc.) being `lower_snake_case`.
For example:

```c++
#include <sb-mapreduce/some-class.h>

auto c = shiraz::MapReduce::SomeClass{}.some_method();
```

As can be seen, the library is contained inside the `shiraz::MapReduce` namespace.

Thus far, the main user-visible identifiers are within this namespaces; no sub-namespaces required.
That is, other than a `::utils` namespace, that provides some helper functions the user may find useful.
For example, `shiraz::MapReduce::utils::log_file()` that will log some lines of a file to stdout.
